JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used programming language primarily known for its role in web development. It enables developers to create dynamic, interactive web applications. Key concepts include variables for storing data, functions for reusable blocks of code, and conditional statements for decision-making. Loops allow for repetitive tasks, while arrays and objects organize and manipulate data. JavaScript interacts with web pages through the Document Object Model (DOM), enabling dynamic updates. It also supports advanced concepts like classes for object-oriented programming, closures for encapsulation, and asynchronous operations for handling tasks that don't block execution. Understanding JavaScript empowers developers to build interactive, user-friendly web experiences.
